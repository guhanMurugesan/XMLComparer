# GillSoft.XmlComparer
Library for comparing and Patching (work in progress) XML files

Using this library, XML files can be compared using DOM elements instead of pure text.

This way the order of elements does not matter.

Unit tests have been written to cover many scenarios. More will be added later on.

A sample program with two XML files is also included for a quick run!
